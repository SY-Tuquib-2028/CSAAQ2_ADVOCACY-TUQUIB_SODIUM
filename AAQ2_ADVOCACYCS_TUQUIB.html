            <p>Bullying is an aggressive behavior that involves a power imbalance. It can take many forms, including physical, verbal, social, and cyberbullying. Bullying impacts everyone: the victim, the bully, and the bystanders.SDG 16(Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions) includes the topic of bullying. This topic is very common among people. The purpose of this website is to remind you about the
dangers of bullying. Bullying is when people repeatedly and intentionally use words or actions against someone or a group of people to cause distress. It has different types, verbal, physical, social, and cyber. Bullying has a lot of harmful and dangerous effects and it should be stopped. Why? Because a lot of these situations end up with victims having trauma, insecurities, trust issues, depression, self-harm, or even worse, suicide. It was all a joke, right? It's not a joke if the person is taking pictures of you without consent, talking behind their back, laughing at their profile pictures, stalking the person, spreading false rumors, body shaming and discrimination of body color, and posting things on social media about that person. Take the case of the K-pop Idol, Sulli. Sulli died due to suicide after a long struggle with online bullying. Sulli died on October 14, 2019, in Simgok-dong, Seongnam-si, South Korea. Some media outlets linked Sulli's death to depression caused by cyberbullying. A month after her death, her friend, Goo Hara, known to be a former member of the girl group KARA. was found dead at her home in Seoul. They are just a small part of the population included in the total deaths and traumatized individuals who suffered from the effects of bullying. Bullying needs to stop because it can result in physical injury, social and emotional distress, self-harm, and even death. “They were doing that because they also have problems”
please always remember to seek help and see if the things you do will cause damage to the person you commit.</p>
